5.98	6.06	i
6.06	6.3	think
6.3	6.4	the
6.4	6.82	worst
6.82	7.24	food
7.24	7.42	that
7.42	7.81	would
7.81	7.96	be
7.96	8.69	liquefied
8.69	8.89	and
8.89	9.12	drank
9.12	9.27	through
9.27	9.34	a
9.34	9.87	straw
10.52	10.9	would
11.17	11.8	be
12.66	13.36	something
13.36	13.97	meaty
14.21	14.49	because
14.49	14.55	i
14.55	14.73	don't
14.73	14.93	think
14.93	15.06	that
15.06	15.25	would
15.25	15.98	liquefy
15.98	16.4	well
16.4	16.64	like
16.64	16.71	i
16.71	16.92	can't
16.92	17.4	imagine
17.4	17.8	eating
18.01	18.48	drinking
18.48	18.52	a
18.52	19.32	steak
19.97	20.09	but
20.09	20.33	maybe
20.33	20.41	i'll
20.41	20.71	feel
20.71	20.96	about
20.96	21.06	it
21.06	21.48	differently
21.48	21.63	when
21.63	21.73	i'm
21.77	22.14	old
31.09	31.26	i
31.26	31.9	think
31.95	32.32	that
32.35	32.45	i
32.45	32.66	can
32.66	33.01	do
33.05	33.41	almost
33.46	33.99	anything
34.14	34.57	better
34.77	35.0	than
35.0	35.36	90
35.36	35.9	percent
35.9	36.12	of
36.12	36.22	the
36.22	36.68	people
36.68	37.22	because
37.46	37.58	as
37.58	37.65	i
37.65	37.87	look
37.87	38.25	around
38.25	38.62	me
38.62	38.77	and
38.77	38.84	i
38.84	39.36	see
39.78	39.88	the
39.88	40.36	people
40.36	40.49	and
40.49	41.29	humanity
41.29	41.41	and
41.41	41.54	the
41.58	42.01	actions
42.01	42.14	of
42.18	42.6	others
43.04	43.16	i
43.16	43.62	feel
43.62	44.0	that
44.0	44.63	i'm
44.77	45.07	just
45.07	45.38	better
45.38	45.59	than
45.59	45.96	everyone
45.96	46.33	else
54.45	54.53	the
54.53	54.79	most
54.79	55.37	amazing
55.37	55.7	nature
55.7	56.24	place
56.24	56.46	that
56.46	56.72	i've
56.72	56.95	been
56.95	57.4	to
57.98	58.94	definitely
58.94	59.17	has
59.17	59.27	to
59.27	59.6	be
59.6	59.73	in
59.73	60.26	canada
60.81	61.51	maybe
61.51	61.99	probably
61.99	62.21	even
62.21	62.8	quebec
62.8	63.35	have
63.45	63.71	been
63.71	63.97	going
63.97	64.08	in
64.08	64.46	the
64.46	64.76	eastern
64.76	65.66	townships
65.66	65.91	and
65.91	66.35	walking
66.35	66.74	through
66.74	66.84	the
66.84	67.63	forest
67.63	67.82	and
67.82	68.08	seeing
68.08	68.21	the
68.21	68.51	different
68.55	69.11	animals
69.11	69.35	running
69.35	69.85	around
69.85	69.98	there
69.98	70.19	was
70.19	70.42	really
70.42	70.47	a
70.47	70.72	great
70.72	71.41	experience
71.41	71.62	and
71.62	71.79	i
72.2	72.37	was
72.37	72.53	really
72.53	72.85	happy
72.85	72.98	to
72.98	73.12	be
73.12	73.32	there
73.32	73.47	when
73.47	73.54	i
73.54	73.66	was
73.66	73.91	there
83.78	83.91	the
83.91	84.26	next
84.26	84.92	thing
84.95	85.07	to
85.07	85.26	be
85.26	86.33	obsolete
86.33	86.6	oh
87.48	88.34	it's
88.34	88.72	hard
88.72	89.01	to
89.01	89.78	imagine
89.78	89.86	i
89.86	90.06	try
90.06	90.15	to
90.15	90.5	see
90.5	90.81	what's
90.81	91.41	around
91.41	91.98	me
92.52	92.97	maybe
92.97	93.32	motion
93.65	93.84	capture
93.88	94.18	maybe
94.54	95.97	data
96.0	96.56	sets
96.56	97.3	something
97.3	97.57	to
97.57	97.79	think
97.79	98.05	about
98.05	98.2	while
98.2	98.31	we're
98.31	98.54	doing
98.54	98.72	this
98.72	99.52	exercise
99.68	100.12	hopefully
100.12	100.32	not
100.32	100.41	the
100.41	100.99	technology
100.99	101.12	we're
101.12	101.78	developing
101.78	102.01	right
102.01	102.33	now
109.36	109.46	the
109.46	109.81	most
109.84	110.36	annoying
110.4	110.88	animal
110.88	111.03	in
111.03	111.16	the
111.2	111.57	animal
111.57	112.1	kingdom
112.14	112.59	without
112.59	112.67	a
112.67	113.16	doubt
113.23	113.4	is
113.4	113.53	the
113.53	113.93	beaver
114.71	115.22	because
115.4	115.49	it
115.49	115.78	just
115.78	116.23	chews
116.23	116.45	on
116.45	117.09	things
117.09	117.22	and
117.22	117.33	it
117.33	117.75	creates
117.75	118.15	dams
118.15	118.24	and
118.24	118.33	it
118.33	118.74	stops
118.74	119.08	water
119.08	119.2	it's
119.2	119.37	just
119.37	119.64	making
119.64	119.69	a
119.69	120.23	mess
